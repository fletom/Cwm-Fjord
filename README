Pangrams (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram) are sentences which contain all the letters of the English alphabet at least once. They are one of the most difficult to write, but also one of the most satisfying and beautiful forms of writing in existence.

Examples include:
	Cwm fjord bank glyphs vext quiz.
	The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
	The five boxing wizards jumped quickly.
